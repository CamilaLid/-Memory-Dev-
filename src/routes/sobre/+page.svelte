  <p>This Memory Game was developed as a project that takes part in the conclusion 
    of the subject of Imperative Programming.
  </p>

  <p>In this game, the objective is to find the right pairs of cards, 
    turning them one at a time. Select one of the cards to reveal the 
    content of said card, and then select another card to see if you found a pair. 
    If the cards you have turned have the same symbol, the cards will remain turned. 
    If not, they will return to their initial state. Continue turning cards and 
    searching for the corresponding pairs. The game will end when you find all the pairs.
  </p>
